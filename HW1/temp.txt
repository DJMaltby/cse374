Linus Torvalds created the Linux kernel and oversaw open source development of the widely-used Linux operating system. 

Torvalds was born on December ,  in Helsinki, Finland. Torvalds enrolled at the University of Helsinki in , graduating with a master's degree in computer science. His M.Sc. thesis was titled Linux: A Portable Operating System.An avid computer programmer, Linus authored many gaming applications in his early years.

After purchasing a personal computer with an Intel  CPU, he began using Minix, an Unix-inspired operating system created by Andrew Tannenbaum for use as a teaching tool. Torvalds started work on a new kernel, later to be named "Linux", in the fall of  and after forming a team of volunteers to work on this new kernel, released V. in the spring of .

In , Torvalds accepted an invitation to visit the California headquarters of Transmeta, a start-up company in the first stages of designing an energy saving central processing unit (CPU). Torvalds then accepted a position at Transmeta and moved to California with his family. Along with his work for Transmeta, Torvalds continued to oversee kernel development for Linux.In , Torvalds left Transmeta to focus exclusively on the Linux kernel, backed by the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL), a consortium formed by high-tech companies, which included IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, AMD, RedHat, Novell and many others. The purpose of the consortium was to promote Linux development. 

OSDL merged with The Free Standards Group in January  to become The Linux Foundation. 

Torvalds remains the ultimate authority on what new code is incorporated into the standard Linux kernel.
